Good evening boys and girls. Ladies, Mmmmm, and gentlemen. Turn the lights down low and shut your faces, as I wrap you in the cozy blanket of a story. A story as heart warming and soft as a mother's kiss, or is it? Shhhhh…Once upon a time there was a boat, now this wasn't just any boat children. It was a ship! A ship full of friends, hundreds of friends, best friends one and all! A veritable Friend-ship it was… Get it? But it wouldn't be very lady like of me to forget to mention the most noteworthy friend on board, Hatty Hattington. Say hi to Hatty! Hatty was like King friend of friendship kingdom, best friend to one and all, and the walking definition of a handsome gentlemen! Now one fine morning, Hatty and pals set out on a new, exciting adventure. What fantastic wonders will they discover this time? Perhaps they'll come across a scary ghost ship. Perhaps they'd find an island made entirely of candy! Perhaps they'd find a band of scary, swash-buckling pirates and to join for forces to find an island made entirely of candy! Who knew? But it didn't matter… So long as they were together, there were smiles to be had and adventures to be shared. Now today t'was a day like any other adventure-y day, spirits were uncrushably high, everyone was singing and dancing and having a jolly time! When suddenly the ocean was like "Suprise!" and a huge, massive storm brewed out of no where!(Thunder crashing, Rain intensifies) Boy, that was quick!(Wind grows stronger)And there was lighting, BOOM!And thunder, BOOM!And the wind, BOO— ER WHOOSH!(Storm calms, wind gusts)And like that, it was over."Is everyone okay?" said Hatty, "I don't know what I'd do if I lost even one of you!" Hatty continued.(Wind gusts intensifies)But the eye of the storm can be very misleading children, NEVER TURN YOUR BACK ON IT! Because the ocean was like "Psyche!" and the storm can back even bigger this time, twice as big! As if Poseidon himself extended his hand in friendship and they spat in his mouth!(Storm grows stronger) Boy he was pis— he was mad! And the rain came down like a shower of bullets, and the floorboards were buckling and creaking and pieces of their ship came raining down like shards of broken dreams, and then Reginald come upstairs and he's all like, "I say gentlemen, I do believe we are in quite a spot of bother!" and everyone was like, "Really?! What tipped you off genius?" and then Hatty was all like, "Hey be nice! "Whoosh-oosh! Giant waves thrashed the boat to and fro, fro and to, Carelessly sprinkling friend after friend into the dark, unforgiving abyss of the deep, dark ocean, everyone was screaming like, "HELP ME!"(Waves grow) Splash! Splash! Then there was this huge whale like, "Muahhhh!" made it super scary. And I think there was a shark… Yup, there he is! Oh God! And then Hatty was all like, "Hang on to your butts, Land Ho!" And then Bang! Bang-Bang! Smash! A ship wreck! As told by their fate books of fate… and while it seems like the end, this is only the beginning of a fantastic journey for the brave crew of the S.S Friend-ship.
